    The African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) is a canine which is a native species to sub-Saharan Africa. 
    It is the largest wild canine in Africa, and the only extant member of the genus Lycaon, which is distinguished from Canis by dentition highly specialised for a hypercarnivorous diet, and by a lack of dewclaws. 
    It is estimated that about 6,600 adults (including 1,400 mature individuals) live in 39 subpopulations that are all threatened by habitat fragmentation, human persecution, and outbreaks of disease. 
    As the largest subpopulation probably comprises fewer than 250 individuals, the African wild dog has been listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1990.<br>

    The African wild dog is a highly social animal, living in packs with separate dominance hierarchies for males and females. 
    Uniquely among social carnivores, the females rather than the males disperse from the natal pack once sexually mature.<br>

    The species is a specialised diurnal hunter of antelopes, which it catches by chasing them to exhaustion. 
    Its natural enemies are lions and hyenas: the former will kill the dogs where possible, whilst hyenas are frequent kleptoparasites.<br>
