    The African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), also known as the African savanna elephant, is one of two living African elephant species. 
    It is the largest living terrestrial animal, with bulls reaching a shoulder height of up to 3.96 m (13.0 ft) and a body mass of up to 10.4 t (11.5 short tons). 
    It is distributed across 37 African countries and inhabits forests, grasslands and woodlands, wetlands and agricultural land. 
    Since 2021, it has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. 
    It is threatened foremost by habitat destruction, and in parts of its range also by poaching for meat and ivory. 
    It is a social mammal, travelling in herds composed of cows and their offspring. 
    Adult bulls usually live alone or in small bachelor groups. 
    It is a herbivore, feeding on grasses, creepers, herbs, leaves, and bark.
