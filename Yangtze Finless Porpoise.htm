            The Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis) is a species of toothed whale in the family Phocoenidae. 
            It is endemic to the Yangtze River in China, making it the country's only known freshwater cetacean following the possible extinction of the baiji (Lipotes vexillifer).<br>
            It was formerly considered a subspecies of the East Asian finless porpoise (N. sunameri), with the combination of both species going by the scientific name of N. asiaeorientalis, but genetic studies support it being a distinct species, or at least an incipient one, due to the lack of gene flow between it and the other species.
        It has been classified as Critically Endangered.
