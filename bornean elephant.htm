<p><b>
    The Bornean Elephant is a subspecies of the Asian Elephant, physically and behaviourally different from the elephants of mainland Asia.<br>

    Known locally and commonly as ‘Bornean Pygmy Elephants’, they are about a fifth smaller than mainland Indian Elephants but similar in size to populations of Sumatra and the Malaysian Peninsula. 
    They are generally more rotund in appearance with shorter trunks and a smaller rounder face, which makes their ears appear larger. 
    They also have a long tail, which in some individuals reaches all the way down to the ground. 
    Only some males display tusks, which are shorter and straighter than in the mainland elephants.<br>
    
    They are listed endangered by the IUCN<br><br>
