            The Galápagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus) is a penguin endemic to the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador. 
            It is the only penguin found north of the equator. 
            Most inhabit Fernandina Island and the west coast of Isabela Island. 
            The cool waters of the Humboldt and Cromwell Currents allow it to survive despite the tropical latitude. 
            The Galápagos penguin is one of the banded penguins, the other species of which live mostly on the coasts of Africa and mainland South America. 
            It is one of the smallest species of penguin in the world. Because of their warm environment, Galápagos penguins have developed techniques to stay cool. 
            The feathers on their back, flippers, and head are black, and they have a white belly and a stripe looping from their eyes down to their neck and chin. 
            Each penguin keeps only one mate, and breeds year-round. Their nests are typically in caves and crevices as protection against predators and the harsh environment. 
            The Galápagos penguin has a lifespan of about 15 to 20 years, but due to predation, life expectancy in the wild could be significantly reduced.
