        <p><b>The saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis), also called spindlehorn, Asian unicorn, or infrequently, Vu Quang bovid, is one of the world's rarest large mammals, a forest-dwelling bovine native to the Annamite Range in Vietnam and Laos. 
            It was described in 1993 following a discovery of remains in VÅ© Quang Nature Reserve by a joint survey of the Vietnamese Ministry of Forestry and the World Wide Fund for Nature. 
            Saolas have since been kept in captivity multiple times, although only for short periods. 
            A living wild saola was first photographed in 1999 by a camera trap set by WWF and the Vietnamese government's Forest Protection Department.
            It is classified under critically endangered.
