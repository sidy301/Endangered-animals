        <p><b>Orangutans are great apes native to the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia. 
            They are now found only in parts of Borneo and Sumatra, but during the Pleistocene they ranged throughout Southeast Asia and South China. 
            Classified in the genus Pongo, orangutans were originally considered to be one species. 
            From 1996, they were divided into two species: the Bornean orangutan (P. pygmaeus, with three subspecies) and the Sumatran orangutan (P. abelii). 
            In 2017, a third species, the Tapanuli orangutan (P. tapanuliensis), was definitively identified. 
            The orangutans are the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae, which split from the other hominids (gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans) between 19.3 and 15.7 million years ago.<br> 
            All three orangutan species are considered critically endangered. 
            Human activities have caused severe declines in populations and ranges. 
            Threats to wild orangutan populations include poaching, habitat destruction because of palm oil cultivation, and the illegal pet trade. 
            Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated to the survival of orangutans in the wild.</b></p>
